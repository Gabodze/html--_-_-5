    <p class="p-1">
      Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.
      Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design. Designers
      are toolmakers. Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator. Define the
      problem. Play. There's always more than one solution. Empathy is the key
      to resonance. You are not your user.
